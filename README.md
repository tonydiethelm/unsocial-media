This means non technical people can easily* put up a web server to share Stuff with the world. 

(If hosting at home, one would still have to port forward through their home router.)

## Install

<<<<<<< HEAD
##Use
Put Pictures (.jpg, .jpeg, or .png files), text files (.txt or text) and directories into one folder that you will set as the "targetDirectory" in the settings.json file. The app will display your pictures and text, and use the folders as navigation. Arrange as you like. 

##Settings
Right now, the settings are in the settings.json file. This file can be edited with any text editor. 

The target directory is the directory targeted by the app. Hah. Please make sure you don't put a "/" after the directory or the app won't parse some directories correctly. IE: "/home/tony/Public" is ok. "/home/tony/Public/" is not.

## Use

>>>>>>> ddb44d87b126f5b68f2ed2a3e609f74f8161874c

## Settings
Navigate to the settings page by typing in your URI/URL to /settings. Here you can set the directory that you want Unsocial Media to pay attention to. 

If you drop in images (Please use .png or .jpg) they will be displayed in the center of the page. 

If you drop in text files (Please have an extension of .txt), the text will be displayed under the images. 

If you put in folders, they will be used as navigation links. You can fill your folders with more pictures/text files to help organize your content. 

If you put in other files, they will be displayed for download. PLEASE do not put any sensitive files in your Unsocial Media folder!
