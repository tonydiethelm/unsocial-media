# Unsocial Media
Unsocial Media is a small web server / content management system that creates content based on the contents of a folder in your hard drive. Put in Text, Pictures, Files and subfolders and it will make a page. 

This means non technical people can easily* put up a web server to share Stuff with the world. 

(If hosting at home, one would still have to port forward from their home router.)

## Install

## Use


## Settings
Navigate to the settings page by typing in your URI/URL to /settings. Here you can set the directory that you want Unsocial Media to pay attention to. 

If you drop in images (Please use .png or .jpg) they will be displayed in the center of the page. 

If you drop in text files (Please have an extension of .txt), the text will be displayed under the images. 

If you put in folders, they will be used as navigation links. You can fill your folders with more pictures/text files to help organize your content. 

If you put in other files, they will be displayed for download. PLEASE do not put any sensitive files in your Unsocial Media folder!
