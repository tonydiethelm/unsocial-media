#Unsocial Media
Unsocial Media is a small web server and content management system that creates content based on the contents of a folder in your hard drive. Put in Text, Pictures, Files and subfolders and it will make a page. 

This means non technical people can easily* put up a web server to share Stuff with the world. 

(If hosting at home, one would still have to port forward through their home router.)

##Install

##Use
Put Pictures (.jpg, .jpeg, or .png files), text files (.txt or text) and directories into one folder that you will set as the "targetDirectory" in the settings.json file. The app will display your pictures and text, and use the folders as navigation. Arrange as you like. 

##Settings
Right now, the settings are in the settings.json file. This file can be edited with any text editor. 

The target directory is the directory targeted by the app. Hah. Please make sure you don't put a "/" after the directory or the app won't parse some directories correctly. IE: "/home/tony/Public" is ok. "/home/tony/Public/" is not.
