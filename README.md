#Unsocial Media
Unsocial Media is a small web server and content management system that creates content based on the contents of a folder in your hard drive. Put in Text, Pictures, Files and subfolders and it will make a page. 

This means non technical people can easily* put up a web server to share Stuff with the world. 

(If hosting at home, one would still have to port forward through their home router.)
